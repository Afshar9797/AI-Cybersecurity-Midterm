# AI-Cybersecurity-Midterm

This Document is all about the Midterm project of Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity. The requirement of this project is 1. to train a deep neural network, 2.Deploy the model through Amazon Sage Maker 3.creating  a python script that takes in a PE file as a parameter and classify in to two classes such as  Benign or Malicious. To implement this project it is comprised of three subtasks on the complications and approach to creating a solution.

This project was comprises some of the complications in implementing it.In this, I got good experience in handling such big Datasets in terms of training and designing the model architecture to pass through the deep neural network in addition to that, learned what other services are provided by the Amazon Web Services like AWS Sagemaker,EC-2,S3 Bucket and also some machine learning services even I learned how to deploy a model on Cloud using Aws.while I was doing it, explored how do we create end point. In terms of creating client followed the steps how to install Virtual machine on our local machine using virtual box .loaded Portable executable file like putty.exe on Virtual machine eventually, I classified this file as Benign.
